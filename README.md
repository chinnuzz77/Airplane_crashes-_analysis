# Airplane_crashes_analysis
Airplanes the most efficient form of modern transportation ,make the world a small place
by quickly delivering people and cargo from one place to another . As more and more people
use airplanes as a means of transportation the no. of passengers and flight routes have
expanded recent years . Taking these impacts into consideration this projects aims to
discover and analyze reasons for airplane crashes , raise awareness of flight safety, and
better understanding its problems and progress .

#  Conclusions and insights
This analysis will helpful for both aviation industry as well as people who
chooses air ways as their means of transporation.they get better understanding
of how crashes happend ,is there any hope for survival in case anything
happend, and how much safe it is?. We analyze data of around 101 yrs of plane
crashes .From this its clear that early 40's,and 70's to 80's are the worst period
of aviation industry.lots of crashes and the fatalites rate also high, and also that
time the world war 2 happed its also a reason for highest crash rates.Aeroflot
was the worst operator and the planes have doglus c3 as their type had the high
chances to crash. the year which higher crashes were occr in 1972 around 104
crashes.Most accidents took place in canada ,may be which is th riskiest
location.The survived rates were increase from 1980's till 2009.which means
technologies are improved the fatalites rates were decreased and also crash
rates also decreased its a good sign.There is so many reasons for air accidents
may be its technical issue ,air turbulance, terrorist attacks ,or may be piolts
error.eventhough which is a efficient form of modern transpotation.
The results found in this project will benefit the ongoin investigations into this
important topic.Understanding what factors cause airplane crashes helps
aviation industries make continuous improvement in flight safety , and help
raise customer confidence with the use of statistical evidence.
